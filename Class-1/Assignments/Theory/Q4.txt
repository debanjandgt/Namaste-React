Q.What is cross origin in script tag?

In simpler terms, the script tag in React is used to include external JavaScript files in a web page. However, there is a security feature called the "same-origin policy" that prevents scripts from different domains (websites) from accessing each other's data.

If you need to load a script from a different domain, you can use the crossOrigin attribute in the script tag to specify the rules for accessing the data. This attribute can be set to either "anonymous" or "use-credentials", depending on whether or not you want to send credentials (like cookies) along with the request.

By setting the crossOrigin attribute correctly, you can control how the script is allowed to access data from other domains, and ensure that your web page remains secure.
