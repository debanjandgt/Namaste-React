Q.What are The Differences b/w Library and Framework?

When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library.
When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, 
but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
