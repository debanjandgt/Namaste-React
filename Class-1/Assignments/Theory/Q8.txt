Q.Differences b/w async and defer.

Async and defer are both boolean attributes which are used along with script tag to fetch external scrpits efficiently in our webpages.

In normal scenarios whenever the browser is parsing HTMl and suddenly encounters with a script tag then the browser pauses the parsing of html at that time and fetches the script from network and executes it then and there.
And then after the script is done its execution fully then the html again starts parsing... However this is not a good approach as the parsing of html is getting paused...


What happens in async attribute????

In async approach, during the parsing of html , the script file gets fetched asynchronously and whenever the async file is done downloading then the parsing of html stops and the script file starts executing .
And after the script file is done executing ,, the html strts getting parsed by the browser again.



What happens in defer attribute??

in defer scenario, the html parsing and fetching of script is done is parallel.... Whenever the parsing of html is done then only the script is executed....
