Q.What is CDN and Why do we use it?

A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users 

Although the benefits of using a CDN vary depending on the size and needs of an Internet property, the primary benefits for most users can be broken down into 4 different components:

Improving website load times - By distributing content closer to website visitors by using a nearby CDN server (among other optimizations), 
visitors experience faster page loading times. As visitors are more inclined to click away from a slow-loading site, a CDN can reduce bounce rates 
and increase the amount of time that people spend on the site. In other words, a faster a website means more visitors will stay and stick around longer.

Reducing bandwidth costs - Bandwidth consumption costs for website hosting is a primary expense for websites. 
Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, 
thus reducing hosting costs for website owners.

Increasing content availability and redundancy - Large amounts of traffic or hardware failures can interrupt normal website function. 
Thanks to their distributed nature, a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware failure better than many origin servers.
Improving website security - A CDN may improve security by providing DDoS mitigation, improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.
